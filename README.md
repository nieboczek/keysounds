# KeySounds
Play a sound entirely using your keyboard to two output devices.
Made to be used in a Voice Channel with friends.

# TODO
- Print warnings (missing mp3 files, etc)
- Animation for player when audio is randomly triggered (optional)
- Built-in config editor
- Make focus_console work on a minimized console
